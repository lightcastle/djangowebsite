         <p>giv2giv was looking for a knowledgeable software design firm to take us from a standing-start to a working prototype, and we ultimately chose LightCastle Tech. Their expertise extended from software development to the infrastructure required to coordinate and deploy a coordinated team of products. One example of a tool they brought to bear is Jenkins, a Continuous Integration framework. Through some creative scripting, Jenkins performed automated testing on each github commit, and report results in another tool, the giv2giv development team's BaseCamp Campfire chat room. Future efforts include further scripting to push github commits to the production environment upon successful Jenkins test completion. 

It is through use of a number of successful tools like Jenkins that LightCastle has helped move the giv2giv platform development forward with confidence and coordination. From direct experience of real-world problems creatively solved, I highly recommend LightCastle Technical Consultants.</p>
        <p><img src="/static/images/solr.png" style="float:left"/> Solr is an open source search platform&mdash;imagine your own custom search engine&mdash;just as fast
            and intuitive as Google, but configured to do exactly what you want, and to search only the content that interests you.  Solr provides hit highlighting and faceted search, on top
            of the phenomenally fast Lucene full-text search library.  Solr scales. Dynamic clusters, distributed search, and index replication mean you will not
            outgrow its capabilities.</p>
