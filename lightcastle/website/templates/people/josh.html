Josh Brown is the kind of guy who likes figuring things out. He was often the first person that family members came to when they had problems with technology. Despite his proficiency with computers, he studied journalism in college, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 2006 from Valdosta State University. Before coming to LightCastle, Josh put his skills to work at several newspapers, including two dailies with circulation numbers of more than 30,000.

Josh's interest in development budded in high school, when the web was still young. His early efforts at programming were with HTML, although that soon led him to create simple text-based games on his graphing calculator. He graduated from that to general purpose programming languages, using them to make everything from web applications to, yes, more silly text-based games. Josh particularly enjoys Python, though he also likes Ruby. When he's not working, Josh is likely perusing the source code for the Linux kernel, playing videogames, reading fantasy novels or watching Mythbusters.
