<p>
Josh Brown is the kind of guy who likes figuring things out. 

When his Windows computers would go haywire because of viruses or other malware, he hunted the problem doggedly until he solved it. He was often the first person that family members came to when they had problems with technology.
</p>
Josh's interest in development budded in high school, when the web was still young. His early efforts at programming were with HTML, although that soon led him to create simple text-based games on his graphing calculator. Since then, Josh has graduated to general purpose programming languages, using them to make everything from web applications to, yes, more silly text-based games. When he's not working, Josh is likely perusing the source code for the Linux kernel, playing videogames, reading fantasy novels or watching Mythbusters.
