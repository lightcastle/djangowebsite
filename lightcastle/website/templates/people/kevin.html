Kevin Radloff's interest in development took off when he started tinkering with IRC bots in his late teens. He first wrote code for eggdrop-based IRC bots before moving on to create a website for his college communications department using HTML::Mason, a Perl-based web framework. He has a long history with Ruby on Rails, having begun using the framework two days after it was released. Other languages he has experience with include C, C++, Java and Javascript.

Kevin's favorite project to have worked on was a real-time matchmaking effort to connect two equally skilled players in a language-learning game using his favorite language, Ruby. He also finds the bidirectional Android notification system interesting because of its similarty to the matchmaking project he worked on. In his spare time, you can find him camera in hand as he looks for squirrels to photograph or playing RPGs and first-person shooters.
