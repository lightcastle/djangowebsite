Kevin Radloff's interest in development took off when he started tinkering with IRC bots in his late teens. He first wrote code for eggdrop-based IRC bots before moving on to create a website for his college communications department using HTML::Mason, a Perl-based web framework. He has a long history with Ruby on Rails&trade;, becoming one of the first contributors to Rails&trade;. Other languages he has experience with include C, C++, Java and Javascript.

<p>
Kevin's favorite project to have worked on was a real-time matchmaking effort to connect two equally skilled players in a language-learning game using his favorite language, Ruby. In the future, he hopes to do something eminently cool with Android's bi-directional notification system, which also uses real-time xmpp components. In his spare time, you can find him camera in hand as he looks for <a href="http://instagram.com/p/MOuvYkqbZc/#">squirrels to photograph</a> or playing RPGs and first-person shooters.
