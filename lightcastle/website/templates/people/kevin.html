Kevin Radloff



Kevin Radloff's interest in development started when he tinkered with IRC bots in his late teens. He first wrote code for eggdrop-based IRC bots before moving on to use HTML::Mason, a Perl-based web framework. 

He has been using Ruby on Rails nearly as long as it has existed, picking up the framework two days after it was released. He also has experience with C, C++, Java and Javascript. 

Kevin's favorite project to have worked on was a real-time matchmaking effort to connect two equally matched players in a language learning game using Ruby. 

In his spare time, you can find him with his camera in hand or playing video games.
