Whether it's a virtual server or the office fishtank, system monitoring is one of LightCastle's favorite tasks. We keep track of everything from server load to potential system outages and security breaches, working to head off problems before they manifest. LightCastle uses open-source systems, like Nagios and Cacti, to monitor potential bottlenecks. A plethora of scripts, including custom plug-ins, assist in the task. Because of such efforts, clients are provided with information-dense graphs to keep them up-to-date on the state of their systems.

One of LightCastle's favorite achievements on this front is the automated monitoring of the company's fishtank. We plot the tank's temperature each minute, giving comprehensive data about the status of the aquarium, making for some very happy fish.

        <p> In her own words: Tamara “monitors the heck out of every process or system [she] touches,” especially
        when any sort of failure occurs.</p>
        <p>
        From server load to potential system outages and security breaches,
        Tamara Funk observes the entire matrix of systems to head off problems. And for her customers Funk
        interwove her meticulous monitoring with infrastructural stability&mdash;by insisting that critical
        servers be clustered in order to prevent major system breakdowns. With Nagios&trade; monitoring in place
        and custom plug-in scripts, stakeholders got exceptional visibility through her alerting system.
        Upgrade planning was made easier with Tamara's Cacti scripts and templates that produced graphs
        showing server statistics and impact of applications on the hardware.
