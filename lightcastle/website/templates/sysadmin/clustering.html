    <h2>Server Support and Clustering</h2>
    <p>While working with nTelos, Tamara built a server cluster that hosted software and linked the Integrated Voice Response system underlying the company's customer care phone tree and a wireless over-the-air provisioning platform. This allowed handsets to be programmed by inventory and sales employees by dialing a number on the handset. Clustering the servers provided greater stability to the system by granting redundancy, server availability and increased uptime. The provisioning platform streamlined the provisioning of new handsets, removing the need for specific procedures for myriad devices. </p>
