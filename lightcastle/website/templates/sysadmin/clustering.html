    <h2>Server Support and Clustering</h2>
    <p>Tamara Funk supported both internal and external clients in her 11-year career with nTelos.
        Her operating system work bolstered an integrated voice response (IVR), the system underlying the companyâ€™s
        customer care phone tree.
        Additionally, Tamara built a cluster that hosted software that linked the IVR and a wireless over-the-air
        provisioning platform, allowing handsets to be programmed by inventory and sales by dialing a number on the handset.
    </p>

cluster so that we have better uptime. redundancyt availability uptime.

server support is patching upgrading pacakages mamking adding software to support, adding libraries to the system or a specific module, (apache module, perl)

maintained the OS under the IVR software, the os and supporting software. SUN or red hat. solaris, general OS maintenance work, on a physical server. ivr was several servers. 

used to be that go into store an buy phone soembody would have to push bunch of buttons to program numbers into the phone the overthe air system allowed it all to be done wirelessly,
reduced need for physical interaction with deice. quicker than having sales associate do it, and eliminated error. the salesperson could push the information to the phone.

simplifiyed the process enormously, each different phone anufacturer has didfferent programming practices.  ... made things simple repeatable. 
built the cluster that was themediation platform between sales system and the telecommunication specific system that hosted it, so i was the middleware.
