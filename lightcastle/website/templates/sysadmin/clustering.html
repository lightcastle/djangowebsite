    <h2>Server Support and Clustering</h2>
    <p>Tamara Funk supported both internal and external clients in her 11-year career with nTelos.
        Her operating system work bolstered an integrated voice response (IVR), the system underlying the companyâ€™s
        customer care phone tree.
        Additionally, Tamara built a cluster that hosted software that linked the IVR and a wireless over-the-air
        provisioning platform, allowing handsets to be programmed by inventory and sales by dialing a number on the handset.
