        <p><img src="/static/images/diagram2.png" style="float:right"/>While working at Rosetta Stone as a Senior Developer and Manager, Dan designed a number
            software architecture diagrams aimed at building consensus around Rosetta Stone’s growing
            web services and clarifying the roles of back-end developers.  Featured before the highest
            levels of leadership and the entire company, Dan’s artifacts helped shape the implementation
            of major projects and helped build a common understanding of project goals.</p>
