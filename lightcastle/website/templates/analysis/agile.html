        LightCastle approaches development the Agile way, because, let's face it, things change. Ideas and strategies evolve, requirements morph, and technology offers unexpected results. This approach allows for needed flexibility to account for emergency fixes, unexpected difficulties and just about anything else that might cause a delay, while also providing structure to keep a project progressing smoothly. Daily or near daily meetings with clients keep them apprised of progress or delays, and makes for a highly collaborative work process. LightCastle has a wealth of experience in agile software development practices. We have managed Kanban based projects, rigorously applied Scrum, and handled myriad of compromises in between.</p>

        <p>A typical development period, or 'sprint', is a few weeks long. We cover requirements and expectations with the client at the beginning of each sprint, referred to as the 'sprint planning' session. Delineating time periods this way helps to keep other teams involved with the project, like quality assurance, in-the-know as to when they can expect a given feature to be ready for testing.</p>

        <p>The diagram to the right is taken directly from a past project, but the terms, timelines and other details are modified to protect the company's internal information. This diagram shows a three month roadmap from June to August.  It covers four three week sprints, and three iterative releases of the company's core product. The team covered is the “services” team, a core group within the company whose efforts impact other teams and other deliverables throughout the company. The purpose of this diagram was to provide other teams and departments with a concise view of the “services” teams goals and objectives.  </p>

        <p>Our methodology for agile project management mirrors our software architecture methods. Our efforts focus on transparency and clarity for all affected parties. From executives to quality assurance, from project management to conjoined development teams, everyone needs a clear picture of goals, timelines, and deliverables. </p>
