Since he was in high school, Josh has held a sharp interest in technology. His first foray into programming was with HTML; He created a handful of websites (back when geocities was in its heyday) about everything from characters from popular fiction to video games. Also during that time (the late 90s), he hacked on his TI-85 graphing calculator, creating simple text-based games that had little entertainment value.</p>
